ReactJS webapp that accepts user comments related to PDF displayed on top.

Few points to note:

1. This app is intended to run standalone and thus will loose its state (user comments, if any) on page refresh
2. Functionality tested on Chrome and Safari to match whats shown on Wiki page
3. Yarn has been used to build/run project
